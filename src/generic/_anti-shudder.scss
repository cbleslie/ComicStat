  // Making font rendering tweaks here - 05/07/15 - CBL
  // Fonts on OS X will look more consistent with other systems that do not
  // render text using sub-pixel anti-aliasing.

  // Although grayscale is inferior to sub-pixel anti-aliasing, most fonts were
  // designed for the "thinner" anti-aliasing and look better that way.
  // Setting this smoothing beforehand prevents an ugly flickering of font
  // "thickness" when animations start and stop. Browsers use this simpler font
  // smoothing to save on resources when animating or transitioning elements.
  -moz-osx-font-smoothing: grayscale;
  -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased;
